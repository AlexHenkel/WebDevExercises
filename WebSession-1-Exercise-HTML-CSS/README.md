# Web Session 1 Exercise - HTML, CSS & Bootstrap

Your task for this exercise is to reproduce as equal as possible the [following design](https://dribbble.com/shots/2591796-Eklos-Landing-Page-WIP/attachments/515865) into code.

We held a 2 hour session to explain basic concepts of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and started the exercise. You can watch the video (Spanish) and then use the concepts to do your exercise.

### Deliverables

Submit a pull request to this repo with your all your files in this folder `WebSession-1-Exercise-HTML-CSS`.

### Objectives

* Complete your first REAL web site!
* Don't spend to much time with assets (Logo, images, video, etc). Just use whatever image (you can replace the video with a simple image) but respect the size and aspect ratio.
* Use as many Bootstrap helper classes as you can
* Use and understand BEM
* Write code with Emmet
* Use Javascript and jQuery based modules with zero configuration at all (Writting any Javascript is required, just style those components)

### Nice to haves

* Change behaviour of the carousel (Requires Javascript and jQuery knowledge).
* Add the video as an `<iframe>` or as a `<video>`
* Add more content or more pages!
