# Web Session 1 Exercise - HTML, CSS & Bootstrap

Your task for this exercise is to reproduce as equal as possible the [following design](https://dribbble.com/shots/2591796-Eklos-Landing-Page-WIP/attachments/515865) into code.

We held a 2 hour session to explain basic concepts of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and started the exercise. You can watch the video (Spanish) and then use the concepts to do your exercise.

Submit a pull request to this repo with your all your files in this folder `WebSession-1-Exercise-HTML-CSS`.

### Objectives

* Complete your first REAL web site!
* Don't spend to much time with assets (Logo, images, video, etc). Just use whatever image (you can replace the video with a simple image) but respect the size and aspect ratio.
* Try to do it as much responsive as you can. At least it shouldn't be broken in cellphone
* Use as many Bootstrap helper classes as you can
* Use and understand BEM
* Write code with Emmet
* Use Javascript and jQuery based modules with zero configuration at all (Writting any Javascript is required, just style those components)
* Don't worry too much about team section design

### Hints
- To rotate an element (the orange rectangle in section 3), look for CSS property: `transform` and the value `rotate`
- Don't use real assets, just respect size and aspect-ratio.

### Nice to haves

* Completely responsive site with a desing that make sense for mobile and laptop
* Change behaviour of the carousel (Requires Javascript and jQuery knowledge).
* Add the video as an `<iframe>` or as a `<video>`
* Want a real challenge? Go ahead and do Team section with same style
* Add more content or more pages!
