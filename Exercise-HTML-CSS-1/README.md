# Exercise 1: HTML & CSS (Beginner)

You have to complete **Part 3** of this excercise: [http://www.pairuptocode.com/exercises/htmlbasics.html](http://www.pairuptocode.com/exercises/htmlbasics.html). Besides the instructions in the web page, you need to include [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/); you are required (but not limited) to use their [grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/). Get creative an enjoy creating yor first web site! Please add as many extra content as you want.

**Note:** Remember, this is your first web site. Do not feel the preassure that it needs to be perfect. Give your best effort but go at your own pace and that will be appreciated!

**Note 2:** If you still don't have still a text editor or want to try something new, I strongly recommend you to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
